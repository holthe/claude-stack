# Existing Agents Inventory

**Analysis Date:** 2026-01-12

## Summary

**No existing agents found** in any of the scanned locations.

## Locations Scanned

| Location | Status | Agents Found |
|----------|--------|--------------|
| `~/.claude/agents/` | Directory does not exist | 0 |
| `~/git/claude-stack/agents/` | Directory does not exist | 0 |
| `/home/augustin/git/two-socks/.claude/agents/` | Directory does not exist | 0 |
| `/home/augustin/git/family-chores/maggie-v3/.claude/agents/` | Directory does not exist | 0 |
| `/home/augustin/git/quiet-kicks/.claude/agents/` | Directory does not exist | 0 |
| `/home/augustin/git/wedding/.claude/agents/` | Directory does not exist | 0 |

## Implications

This is a **clean slate** - no existing agents to audit for drift. All agents will be created fresh based on the repository analysis.

## Existing Documentation

While no agents exist, the following project documentation files were found that contain context:

| Project | File | Purpose |
|---------|------|---------|
| maggie-v3 | CLAUDE.md | Project context for Claude |
| maggie-v3 | README.md | User documentation |
| maggie-v3 | ROADMAP.md | Feature tracking |
| wedding | CLAUDE.md | AI agent context |
| wedding | README.md | Main documentation |
| wedding | Multiple *_PROMPT.md files | Feature specifications |
| quiet-kicks | README.md | Setup guide |
| quiet-kicks | ROADMAP.md | Feature priorities |
| two-socks | (none found) | - |

These existing documentation files will inform the agent creation process.
