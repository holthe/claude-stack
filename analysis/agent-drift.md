# Agent Drift Analysis

**Analysis Date:** 2026-01-12

## Summary

**No existing agents to analyze for drift.**

All agent locations were scanned and found empty:
- `~/.claude/agents/` - Not found
- `~/git/claude-stack/agents/` - Not found
- Project-specific `.claude/agents/` directories - Not found

## Implications

Since this is a greenfield agent setup:
- No stale references to fix
- No version drift to address
- No deprecated patterns to remove
- No scope changes to evaluate
- No model appropriateness to reassess

## Recommendation

Proceed directly to **Gap Analysis** and **Agent Architecture Design** to create a fresh, optimized agent hierarchy based on current repository state.
